    <div>Started learning Blender seriously in 2016. I used Blender Guru's beginner tutorial for Blender 2.79.</div>
    <div>Did another Blender Guru tutorial. Learned about how lighting works and curves. </div>
    <div>I wanted to make character models and most places said start with the basics so I did the skull. Used some parts of different tutorials and eventually just did the modeling by extruding the faces 1 by 1.</div>
    <div>RWBY has amazing weapons and I wanted to make Yang and Ruby's weapons. This is Ruby's.</div>
    <div>I love Mega Man Star Force so I wanted to recreate the world. This is Geo Stelar's room. My first attempt at modeling using what I have learned so far.</div>
    <div>After taking the 3D Modeling class, I wanted to revist the MMSF room. My start at remodelling. I still hav not figured out texturing normal maps on Blender 2.8.</div>

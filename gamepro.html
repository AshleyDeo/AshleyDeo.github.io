        <h3>Homework 1: Textures and Movement</h3>
        <p>Just 3 rectangles. 1 untextured, 2 textured and one of the textured rectangles rotating.</p>
        <h3>Homework 2: Pong</h3>
        <p>I recreated the game Pong. It is 2 player and has a scoreboard.</p>
        <h3>Homework 3: Space Invaders</h3>
        <p>Clone of Space Invaders using <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/gooperblooper22/art/Space-Invaders-Sprite-Sheet-135338373">textures</a>. It has a score tracking how many rounds a player has won. The original one did not have sound.</p>
        <h3>Homework 4: Platformer</h3>
        <p>This was used to learn how to create and import tilemaps, create player physics and animation of sprites</p>
        <h3>Homework 5: Build Your Own Game</h3>
        <p>I recreated Mega Man Starforce and Mega Man Battle Network. I took <a href="http://sprites-inc.co.uk/index.php"></a>sprites from the game and created the Battle Network battle system and an overworld like in Starforce.</p>

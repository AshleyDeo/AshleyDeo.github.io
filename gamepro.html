            <div class="container">
                <p>I recreated the game Pong. It is 2 player and has a scoreboard.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/AshleyDeo/CS-3113-Projects/tree/master/Homework3%20-%20SOUND%20ADDED">Space Invaders</a></h3>
            <div class="container">
                <p>Clone of Space Invaders using <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/gooperblooper22/art/Space-Invaders-Sprite-Sheet-135338373">textures</a>. It has a score tracking how many rounds a player has won. The original one did not have sound. Homework 6 was to choose one of the previous projects and add sound to it.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/AshleyDeo/CS-3113-Projects/tree/master/Homework4">Platformer Demo</a></h3>
            <div class="container">
                <p>This was used to learn how to create and import tilemaps, create player physics and animation of sprites. The tilemapping was hard at first but very useful for the final project.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/AshleyDeo/CS-3113-Projects/tree/master/Final%20Project">MegaMan Starforce Clone</a></h3>
            <div class="container">
                <p>Using everything we learned in class, we had to create our own game. I recreated Mega Man Starforce and Mega Man Battle Network. I took <a href="http://sprites-inc.co.uk/index.php">sprites</a> from the game and created the Battle Network battle system and an overworld like in Starforce. There are 10 enemies in the overworld and each one has 3 randomized enemies to fight. I took soundtracks for the games and edited them to loop.</p>

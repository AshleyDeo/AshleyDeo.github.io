        The Internet has evolved a lot in the past decade since Web 2.0 was created. The Internet has created many jobs like Youtubers, bloggers, streamer, etc. As long as you have an audience who enjoys your content, you have a job. This has led to very unique and evolving content you can only find on the Internet and may not have been able to be created without it. The Internet in terms of laws and profit have overall stayed the same and may even have gotten worse. When it comes to Copyright Law, it has become harder to get past. Across the whole Internet fanart, music cover and other interpretive media have become harder to create because companies have found it easy to create algorithms that claim revenue from it or remove it so other can not see it. The Internet has led to the massive movement of ownership beacuse with anonymous users from around the world it is hard to really say who owns what in a public space.

            The web gives freedom to the users and the creators. The Internet is like a huge collaboration project. Everyone works on their own pieces and together they make up the whole web. Everyone has access and the ability to create what they want without being censored by others and the government. The Web and the Internet are not the same thing. "The Web is an application that runs on the Internet, which is an electronic network that transmits packets of information among millions of computers according to a few open protocols." The Web is the software and the Internet is the hardware that the Web runs on.

            The Internet is made to be constantly innovating and moving forward. "The goal of the Web is to serve humanity. We build it now so that those who come to it later will be able to create things that we cannot ourselves imagine." The Internet is made so it eventually will be accessible to everyone and add to the social links created online. The freedoms that apply to the real world apply online creating a space where everyone follow the same rules.
